# SQL-Challenge

Instructions
The challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. Let's break down each part:

Data Modeling
Inspect CSV Files: Take a look at the CSV files provided. Understand the structure and contents of each file.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the tables and their relationships. You can use tools like QuickDBD for this task.
Data Engineering
Table Schema Creation: Based on the CSV files, create a table schema for each file. Ensure to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other constraints required.
Import CSV Files: Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. Maintain the correct order while creating tables to handle foreign keys.
Data Analysis
Now, let's dive into analyzing the data:

Basic Queries:
List employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List department number for each employee along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List first name, last name, and sex of employees named Hercules with last names starting with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
Advanced Queries:
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name).
