# SQL Challenge - Pewlett Hackard Employee Database

Welcome to the SQL Challenge for Pewlett Hackard! In this project, you'll be working with historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. Your task involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using six CSV files containing employee records.

## Getting Started

1. **Repository Setup**: Create a new repository named `sql-challenge` specifically for this project. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Project Directory**: Inside your local repository, create a directory named `EmployeeSQL`. This directory will hold all the files related to this challenge.

3. **Download Files**: [Download the necessary files](#) to help you get started with the challenge.

## Instructions

The challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. Let's break down each part:

### Data Modeling

1. **Inspect CSV Files**: Take a look at the CSV files provided. Understand the structure and contents of each file.

2. **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the tables and their relationships. You can use tools like QuickDBD for this task.

### Data Engineering

1. **Table Schema Creation**: Based on the CSV files, create a table schema for each file. Ensure to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other constraints required.

2. **Import CSV Files**: Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. Maintain the correct order while creating tables to handle foreign keys.
